## Overview


This repository holds the data analysis for a research project on predicting football match outcomes. It is explored how various factors, such as team performance, home field advantage, and player statistics, influence the results of football games. We focus on matches from the English Championship, examining key metrics like goals scored, possession percentages, and defensive strategies. The analysis covers a detailed investigation of these factors and their impact on match outcomes over recent seasons. 

Pre-requisite: To run the code scripts, the user must possess R programming language and download certain R packages. 

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data.
-   `outputs/data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.

## LLM Usage
No auto-complete tools such as co-pilot were used in the course of this project, however, Language Learning Model ChatGPT was used while writing this paper. It was used for the purpose of code debugging, understanding models, and knowledge of certain topics, which I was not aware of. The chat with the AI bot is also attached as a reference under inputs\llm..
